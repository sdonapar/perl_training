## Data Types

* **Scalar** - Scalars are simple variables. They are preceded by a dollar sign ($). A scalar is either a number, a string, or a reference. A reference is actually an address of a variable, which we will see in the upcoming chapters.

* **Arrays** - Arrays are ordered lists of scalars that you access with a numeric index which starts with 0. They are preceded by an "at" sign (@).

* **Hashes** - Hashes are unordered sets of key/value pairs that you access using the keys as subscripts. They are preceded by a percent sign (%).


* **Numeric Literals**
  - Integer, Negative integer, Floating point
  - Scientific notation, Hexadecimal, Octal

* **String Literals**
  - Backslash (\\), Single quote (\'), Double quote (\")
  - Newline (\n), Carriage return (\r), Horizontal tab (\t)
